## strengths_weaknesses

* Loved the e-learning but I felt it could have been brought in more in the zoom sessions
* The action learning coaching approach of Lead can be facilitated is the overall strength of Lead.  It enables a safe space where real learning can take place on the given topic and in other areas. The material was engaging and provided an excellent scaffolding for this process.
* Excellent live interaction and teaching materials. Each module duration is just right to balance life/work. No weaknesses I can think of.
* I think the main strength is that we don't solve each others problems but are enabled to come to our own conclusion with the help of others.   the only weakness is that I would always prefer to do in person, but there is a strength in being able to join with others in other areas of the country which would not be possible in person.
* The Action learning groups were really helpful
* It was really good, got me thinking about various areas of healthy leadership and the relationships that i need to manage in my curacy. The action learning group has proved really beneficial to me as even though we are in different roles some of the challenges are the same for us
* I think the main strengths were the content of each module, the  fellowship within the group, the fact we could not offer advice, we had to ask a question which helped us to reflect and find the answers within ourselves. I thought Jayne and her colleague were brilliant! They brought us together and guided us each week. I was really supported by them. It felt like a safe space to share our concerns.  I think I would rather meet face to face but at the same time with other responsibilities online training works well.
* I really enjoy the action learning groups- I found they functioned more as a way of processing the material more than  necessarily coming up with a concrete action each time - which in my case was actually very helpful as while the material was very relevant in a general sense, for me it didn't always align with problems I was immediately facing that week.
* The Action learning set mode of learning was really useful.  The breadth of material provided meant that there was always something which sparked reflection (although I could do with a lot more time to read some of it!)
* I went into the module expecting to be equipped with some tools for enabling leaders, performance management etc. And while I was given those sort of resources, my learning in this module was much, much deeper. I learned most about myself, my impetus for leadership and uncovered some of my reluctance to tackle the difficult parts of being a leader. This is genuinely transformational learning, not just training for a role.
* S= shared experiences  W=zoom
* The module was great, it really got me thinking about various different strategies to overcome challenges or to see things in a new way. Each way I came away encouraged and ready to face the week ahead. The material was really good too, it was nice to be able to dip in and out of the different sections depending on what perked my interest that week.
* Building on previous action learning, both practise and use of models
* strengths. We were a mixed group in age ,sex and experience,however we were able to support each other in a supportive way even when the questions need some thinking to answer them.  Weaknesses It appeared to me that we did not refer enough, during the session, to the reflection info. sent to us.
* strengthens:  listening to others   weaknesses: I personally find being on zoom for over an hour two long.
* Topics covered, particularly the types of people you have around you which can assist you in making decisions about teams which you are building in order to lead (VIPs, VRPs, VNPs etc).  Discussion in a safe place which often created a space where talking with the motivation to make steps forward became a place where talking was praying out loud among friends.  The session on Power particularly helped me to move on from a situation where power had been used very badly to encourage me to appreciate my current situation where power is used wisely and justly.  The evaluation session helped me to see through the eyes of others the progress I have made over the two units covered so far - I have, as a direct result of the comments made by a fellow participant who has been in the same group for both units, stepped over a threshold to a place of restoration.
* helped me think through my relationships in a very helpful way. Struggled applying the power types but that was more relative to my new context than a weakness in the course.
* All Good For Me
* Not sure to be honest  - took a little while to get into the flow of what we were doing. I was surprised how little the preparation materials were actually referred to, although they were clearly an underlying part of what we were doing..
* Strength  Variety of resources Opportunity to discuss with others   Weakness Some Resources dependent on previous training Some resources seemed a bit unrelated to the topic  I found action learning group initially difficult but was beginning to get the hang of it by the end of 4 modules. I don't know how an action learning group could be defined in a better way but I wonder if a practical video would help
* Hearing from others who also are experiencing similar Leadership challenges, in how to bridge or bring about change that is workable for self and others in moving your ministry forward. I found the fact that asking others questions instead of suggestions kept everything focused for the group and by doing so enables the leader to evaluate their own work and then take away and reflect on it. It was good you were given information to work with at each session whether you used it or brought your own situation was both beneficial. Having others from different areas of ministry both clergy and lay,  was great, it brought with it a humility that was tangible in the group and I felt supported by all and able to speak freely without feeling intimidated even though we were on Zoom.   Overall a positive experience, and a good learning platform.
* Analyse oneself but answer/ advice/ questions came from others.
* Not everyone understood the idea of pursuing your own learning or approaching the subject in your own way. Some expected a talk with answers given!  For me, that was one of the strengths of the approach. With the Dig Deeper material I was able to listen to talks and lectures, which I find helpful, but reflect on aspects of the subject that were useful to me.
* I can see how the content related to the title and there appeared to be good depth of coverage (although i was unable to work through all of it).  I found the focus rather bias to full time workers rather than volunteers such as myself.
* The relaxed format and the opportunity to express your thinking with no pressure on time
* The choosing of a learning goal that is tailored and beneficial to the ministry. Mine was managing and raising the performance of other team members
* Good to think about stakeholders, and be aware of different ways of communicating with them. Great to have some time out to do some reflecting on my leadership, and lovely to have input of others to help me do that.
* There is a lot of relevant and important subjects for consideration in this module ... healthy habits, boundaries, relationships and the use of power. The course provided good materials and resources for exploring the topics. However, I feel that some of the topics could do with more in depth and longer exploration as a group.
