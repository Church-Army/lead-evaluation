## how_changed_leadership

* Thinking about my vision and putting it into action
* The module gave me much needed space to reflect on the different teams I am in and the way that I operate leadership of/within them. As a result I am more conscious of the modes that I am in within different teams and can tailor my responses to situations accordingly.
* Thinking more about my  to projects and conversations with leadership
* As a result of the module, I am more aware of different ways of leading and have been given the confidence to put some of them into practice
* It has helped me find ways to be more prepared but also to let go of needing to be in control of everything.
* It has got me thinking more about the various relationships i need to manage, and made me more aware of how i continue to develop these relationships. It made me consider where my boundaries lie and what is important for me in my role as a new leader
* When ever I feel out of my depth or facing difficult situations I say to myself 'You're the leader so lead!'  I have found it easier to cope with difficult situations and have those difficult conversations where I have had to confront individuals with how they have treated me or how they have treated others. I think the course has made me braver!
* I've found the reflective element really helpful and this has caused me to slow down when it comes to decision making and  be able to take in more information as well as being more confident and at peace with decisions once I've made them.
* The module has increased the tools available to me which in turn improves my confidence
* Rather than seeing it as a set of competencies I can learn to achieve, I'm seeing leadership as more of a skill, an art, a role to inhabit.
* Not feeling like I have to solve everything or have all the answer's
* It has made me realise that i donâ€™t have to try to be a replica of my boss, that i can do ministry in my own way and in a way that is authentic to my giftings and strengths
* Leading others into lay leadership in preparation for multi-parish ministry: sending others into teams to collaborate in positive change rather than simply being told what to do (spoon fed leading to tick box change, not change of long term practises) regarding AROCHA Bronze Award.  People are starting to come up with their own ideas, with enthusiasm, rather than expecting clergy to do everything!
* It has enhanced a unit within IME2 curacy training where we are asked to develop and show the ability to build and lead teams which carry out the work which clergy cannot do themselves in addition to clerical duties and remain healthy and sane. So, projects which need to happen can be led, but we are still able to devote our time to prayer, pastoral care, leading services, preaching, running Lent courses and so forth, without running ourselves ragged.
* helping me build local relationships. Also increasing my awareness of boundaries, time of, time out.
* more reflection on leadership roles
* This has come at the right time for me as I am beginning to work with and form new teams in a new context. Has just helped me open my eyes a little more to what I am doing and reflect more how they can be more effective. Increasingly recognising the importance of conflict and strategies around it.
* By allowing myself  to listen more to what is going on practically. Observing  what could be the possible struggles giving space for others to speak.  How to challenge myself in how to approach leadership with others that allows effective working.
* We looked at Healthy Leadership and it has made me appreciate the continual need to lead with an attitude of love. In leadership it is so easy to move away from that.
* It helped me think about prioritising, and about the need to look after one self and have protected time
* Set up regular 'formal' supervision with team member, keeping minutes and detailing action points and monitoring progress
* More aware of how I relate to different stakeholders at different levels. In fact, a general increase in self-awareness in this area.
* This module focused on very important topics ... healthy habits and rhythms to sustain leadership ... Healthy boundaries - I feel that this subject needs more exploration for evangelists in professional practice ... Healthy relationships - this is another subject that could do with deeper exploration and learning ... and Healthy Power.  Alot of great topics here ... worthy of further and deeper  study and learning ... thanks Jane and team
