I thought Jayne and her colleague were brilliant! They brought us together and guided us each week. I was really supported by them. It felt like a safe space to share our concerns.  I think I would rather meet face to face but at the same time with other responsibilities online training works well.",All of it,Strongly agree,Yes,Yes,"Yes, a great deal",When ever I feel out of my depth or facing difficult situations I say to myself 'You're the leader so lead!'  I have found it easier to cope with difficult situations and have those difficult conversations where I have had to confront individuals with how they have treated me or how they have treated others. I think the course has made me braver! ,Strongly agree,Jayne always sent us out the information we needed for the next module which I found really helpful.,Strongly agree,The feedback was honest and encouraging.

",Most of it,Agree,Yes,Yes,"Yes, somewhat",I've found the reflective element really helpful and this has caused me to slow down when it comes to decision making and  be able to take in more information as well as being more confident and at peace with decisions once I've made them.,,,,

I learned most about myself, my impetus for leadership and uncovered some of my reluctance to tackle the difficult parts of being a leader. This is genuinely transformational learning, not just training for a role.

The session on Power particularly helped me to move on from a situation where power had been used very badly to encourage me to appreciate my current situation where power is used wisely and justly.  The evaluation session helped me to see through the eyes of others the progress I have made over the two units covered so far - I have, as a direct result of the comments made by a fellow participant who has been in the same group for both units, stepped over a threshold to a place of restoration.",All of it,Strongly disagree,No,Yes,"Yes, a great deal","It has enhanced a unit within IME2 curacy training where we are asked to develop and show the ability to build and lead teams which carry out the work which clergy cannot do themselves in addition to clerical duties and remain healthy and sane.

It was good you were given information to work with at each session whether you used it or brought your own situation was both beneficial. Having others from different areas of ministry both clergy and lay,  was great, it brought with it a humility that was tangible in the group and I felt supported by all and able to speak freely without feeling intimidated even though we were on Zoom.
